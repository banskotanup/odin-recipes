    <p>This delicious stuffed eggplant with a cheesy top is a must-try recipe! Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini <br>eggplants and use them for a side dish or appetizer.</p>
    <h3>Stuffed Eggplant Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggplant:</strong> Youâ€™ll need one eggplant (halved lengthwise) to make two <br>servings. </li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Brush the shells with olive oil before seasoning with salt <br>and pepper. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This stuffed eggplant is seasoned with salt, pepper, <br>fresh garlic, and fresh basil. </li>
        <li><strong>Sausage:</strong> Sweet Italian sausage makes this stuffed eggplant a <br>hearty, crowd-pleasing meal. </li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> An onion and fresh mushrooms lend texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta sauce:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade tomato-basil pasta <br>sauce. </li>
        <li><strong>Bread crumbs:</strong> Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs give the <br>stuffed eggplant a welcome crunch. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan <br>cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff. </li>
    </ul>
