This is the project provided by TOP in order to gain depth knowledge about html. Here we will make a simple website using html with it's different tags only.

After completion of this project I would have learned how to use html to provide the structure to the websites? How can I use different html elements and tags to make website structure better for everyone i.e. for screen reader as well. I would have learned about the images and other different tags and attributes as well.
